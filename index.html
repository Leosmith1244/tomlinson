        <p class="mb-4">Robert "Bob" Tomlinson was born around 1844 in Ohio to Thomas and Mary Tomlinson, English immigrants who settled in Diamond Bluff, Wisconsin. At ~17, he enlisted in the Union Army, joining Company B, 6th Wisconsin Infantry, part of the famed Iron Brigade. Known for his bold spirit, nicknamed "Bombastes Furioso," Robert fought bravely in major Civil War battles before his capture and death at Andersonville Prison at age ~20. He is my great-great-granduncle, brother of my great-great-grandmother.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Robert enlisted on May 10, 1861, in Company B, 6th Wisconsin Infantry, the "Prescott Guards," and mustered in on July 16, 1861. As part of the Iron Brigade, he fought in key Eastern Theater battles:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Gainesville (Brawner’s Farm), August 1862</strong>: First major combat, facing Stonewall Jackson.</li>
                <li><strong>Antietam, September 1862</strong>: Fought in the Cornfield, defiantly firing alone.</li>
                <li><strong>Gettysburg, July 1863</strong>: Wounded in shoulder at McPherson’s Ridge/Railroad Cut.</li>
                <li><strong>Buckland Mills, October 1863</strong>: Captured while rushing to join the fight.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Captured on October 19, 1863, at Buckland Mills, Virginia, Robert was sent to Andersonville Prison, where he died on June 28, 1864, likely from disease, and was buried at Andersonville National Cemetery (grave 2582).</p>
