  <h1>A Soldier’s Letter from the Line of Battle</h1>
  <h2>Near Haymarket, Virginia • October 26, 1863</h2>
  <h3>(Letter to M. B. G.)</h3>
  <blockquote>
    “We left Centreville yesterday morning in a cold, beating rainstorm…”
  </blockquote>
  <p>We marched toward Warrenton, passing the battlefields of Bull Run and Gainesville. Cavalry units ahead of us skirmished with the enemy throughout the day. By evening, we bivouacked near Haymarket, cannon fire still echoing from the front.</p>
  <p>Just as we began cooking supper, an officer burst in with urgent news—our cavalry had been attacked at Broad Run by overwhelming numbers. General Newton immediately ordered the brigade out to their relief.</p>
  <p>We double-quicked a mile before gunfire and cheering erupted near the camp we had just left. The enemy’s cavalry was all around us.</p>
  <p>We quickly formed a line of battle at the edge of the woods. The rebel cavalry approached but retreated upon seeing our formation. We held position late into the night, then fell back a mile to find the entire First Corps in battle line.</p>
  <p>The Seventh Wisconsin lost forty men who were on picket duty.<br>
  We lost one man—captured.</p>

  <h2>“Do You Remember Tomlinson?”</h2>
  <h3>— A Reflection from General Bragg</h3>
  <blockquote>
    “Do you remember Tomlinson of Company B? They called him ‘Bob.’”
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the early camp days, Bob was full of swagger—known as a sort of <em>“Bombastes Furioso.”</em> But when it mattered, he proved as brave as he boasted.</p>
  <p>At Antietam, when your company fell back from the cornfield, Bob shouted,</p>
  <blockquote>
    “Not yet! I have a few more cartridges left!”
  </blockquote>
  <p>And stood his ground, firing alone in an open field.</p>
  <p>At Gettysburg, he suffered a terrible shoulder wound. Sent to hospital, he later escaped and rejoined us with the wound still open. His spirit was stronger than his body.</p>
  <p>During the surprise attack near Buckland, we were caught off guard while butchering beef. The Sixth was called into light-marching formation to repel cavalry—who fled faster than they charged.</p>
  <p>Bob had been left at the commissary, unarmed, guarding meat. But the fire in him refused to stay back. He found a pistol, took a shortcut through the woods to join us, and was captured by stray rebel cavalry.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “He gave his life for his country… in a rebel prison.”
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Life in the Field</h2>
  <p>We carry provisions in panniers on two pack mules—blankets but no shelter. It's been two weeks since we’ve seen our regimental headquarters wagon. With no sutlers allowed to follow the army, we are making do with what we have.</p>
  <p>We go without, and we press on.</p>
